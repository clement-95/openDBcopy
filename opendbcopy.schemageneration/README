First of all - using this plugin requires some further explanation.

Migrating a schema is done using Hibernate's Tools (Extension library) http://www.hibernate.org

After the .hnm.xml files are generated, please run from the root directory of the project in the command line
"gradle schemacreate".

Please see the User Manual for detailed instructions.
