                openDBcopy requires a Java Runtime Environment 1.4 or higher to be installed.

                    To install openDBcopy enter the following command in a console window:
                    <br/>
                    <b>java -jar opendbcopy-xx-install.jar</b>
                    (replace xx with the current version)
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    You are then guided through the installation process. Windows users can create Shortcuts
