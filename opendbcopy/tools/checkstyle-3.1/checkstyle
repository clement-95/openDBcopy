Hello,

First, yes, you can use opendbcopy to migrate data from your db2 to Oracle
- in general. That is what I first developed opendbcopy for. In the
meantime new features have been added.

A new version 0.50 is under development which will fix some bugs and
provide the ability to migrate schemas too! Including constraints and
indexes.

May I ask what JDK you are using on the two machines?

The one with the sax error you can fix by downloading sax library from the
internet and place it inside opendbcopy/lib. It is strange. You are not
the first one facing this problem. I never had this so I cannot debug.
However, if you place sax.jar into the lib directory you should be able to
launch it.

Maybe you will be facing an error when opendbcopy tries to retrieve first
metadata of DB2. If so, I can send you a hotfix if you send me the error.
The new version will not run into this problem anymore.

May I ask what the complexities are in your migration project?

cheers,
Anthony
