WHAT IS OPENDBCOPY
******************
opendbcopy is a universal database utility to copy data from and to any database 
given a JDBC driver (or JDBC:ODBC bridge) without having to write any dump 
files first and setting up mapping files. Standard filters are included. Custom 
plugins can easily be added to do whatever operation you like (see developer manual).
The complete project model (including the database metadata) can be saved using XML format. 
A nice GUI helps you to manage your migration operations. 
You can also execute your database migration processes as batch jobs. 

Several standard converters such as trimming texts, removing whitespaces between
texts, inserting NULL instead of empty strings into nullable fields are already ready to use.

opendbcopy has been developed because standard products (Open Source), as far as known, do not provide 
a flexible way to apply custom filters such as merging fields etc. 

You define how easy or sophisticated you want to filter and migrate your data.

A plugin to produce SQL dumps for the appropriate destination database of your migration 
or delimited data files such as csv or other file type can be created using the appropriate plugin.
